# sockH3lix

Jailbreak for iOS 10.x 64bit devices without KTRR

Replace the exploit from v0rtex to [sock port](https://github.com/jakeajames/sock_port) by Jake James with higher success rate and shorter time.

Kernel patches and other resources are inherited from doubleH3lix.

Only test on my 5s(10.3.3). 10.x 64bit devices is supported in theory. Use at your own risk.

This jailbreak tool is compatible with doubleH3lix, which means you can switch between them at any time.
